# reactjs-todoapp

 This is my first to do list using Vite - ReactJS with Hooks and TailwindCSS styles

I used these Hooks:
- useLocalStorage
- useState
- UseEfect

 useLocalStorage allows data to be stored locally in the browser used by the user while browsing. 
This information will be stored forever in each new session that the user initiates in his browser, unless of course, we want to delete it for some reason.
